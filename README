This is a distributed intrusion detection framework based on the master-worker paradigm. Many workers sniff the network traffic by being deployed in key locations throughout a network.

The solution is targeted at cloud infrastructures to employ idle resources.

How to use:

use environment_deploy.sh to deploy namespace built network environment
use makefile to build
master.out - needs no parameters
worker.out <interface name> <master hostname>
